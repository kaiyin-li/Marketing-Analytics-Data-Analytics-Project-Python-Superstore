## Overview
This project applies data analytics and machine learning techniques to a transactional retail dataset
to analyze customer behavior, product profitability, and pricing dynamics.

## Business Question
- How can customers be segmented based on value and purchasing behavior?
- Which products and categories drive profit versus margin erosion?
- How do discount strategies affect sales volume and profitability?

## Data
- Transaction-level retail dataset (orders, customers, products, discounts)
- Data is publicly available

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and feature engineering (customer- and product-level aggregation)
- RFM analysis to quantify customer value
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Profitability analysis at category and segment levels
- Predictive modeling to evaluate sales and profit patterns

## Key Findings
- Clear separation between high-value, price-sensitive, and dormant customer segments
- Certain categories show volume-driven growth but margin erosion under deep discounts
- High-value segments respond differently to discount intensity

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritize high-value segments with targeted promotions
- Optimize discount depth for margin-sensitive categories
- Adjust category-level pricing and promotion strategies

## Limitations
- Analysis is exploratory and based on historical data
- Not intended as a production or real-time system
